This project simulates 2 ultrasonic transudcer seperated by a distance (integer multiple of half wavelength)
to observe the nodes formed in between them. Each source is treated as a 5-point array to get source directionality.
Sine wave is used as source. Due to boundary conditions waves reflect from the boundary after certain time has elapsed.
Code based on course - Computers, Waves, Simulations: A Practical Introduction to Numerical Methods.
